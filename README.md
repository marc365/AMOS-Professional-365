This repository is 68k Assembly and unique in design. It is powerful and runs like an operating system. Games and multimedia become exciting to program again, relying on your own skills instead of libraries.

This release is as-is and doesn't contain any installation or demos.

It's really fun and will test your "actual" programming skills!

# AMOS Professional

based on the original 68000 source code by François Lionet (Thank you!) 

# History
Some years ago there was discussion of re-development, but the work mentioned in [this article](http://www.amiworld.it/news/amos_upgrade_eng.html) was not made public, any collaborative efforts have disappeared. An archive was made available at a later date but was partially incomplete and difficult to build - this project fixes the build problems, but has no relation to any previous plans or news releases.

# AMOS PRO goes Public Domain!

> [01 dec 2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20130530022407/http://www.pianetaamiga.it)
In occasion of Pianeta Amiga 2012, Pietro Ghizzoni, current owner of AMOS Pro sources after Francois Lionet ceased development, has kindly agreed to release them as Public Domain. You can download the full package in advance from this link. Sources will be also put on Aminet in the next days.

# AMOS Professional X : present and future

After seeing the marc365 repository containing a useable Amos Professional project, I decided to jump and explore the project source code. During that deep view, I learned enough parts and components of the internal graphical system of Amos Professional. Following this, I decided to create a new project called "Amos Professional X" (special) to add the support of AGA chipset to Amos Professional. The branch "main" is the project branch. Each other branch are dev ones and are merged to the 'main' branch once the work made for them is completed and tested. It's a personal "free time" project so progress can be irregular.
